Project Title: Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV
Description: Developed a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Python to capture, process, and save video frames from a webcam. The project utilized Haar cascades for accurate face detection, and optimized performance by tuning detection parameters.

Implemented real-time video capture and frame processing using OpenCVâ€™s cv2.VideoCapture and CascadeClassifier.
Developed a face detection algorithm utilizing Haar cascades to accurately identify faces in web cam.
Configured video output to save processed video with face detection overlays and frame counts.
Adjusted detection parameters such as scaleFactor and minNeighbors to enhance detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
